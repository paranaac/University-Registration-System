# University-Registration-System
Databases Project #1 - CLI univeristy registration system using a database.

Implement a University Registration System in Java using JDBC

Database users:

Staff: These users can add and delete courses and students, and register and drop courses for students. At the end of the semester, grades should be uploaded.

# The following real-world constraints need to be enforced:

Students cannot register for a class twice for the same year and semester.

If a course is deleted, all registrations of that course need to be deleted too. (delete from registration table first, then delete it from the course table.)

If a student is deleted from the system, all registrations of that student need to be deleted too. (delete from registration table first, then delete it from the student table.)
